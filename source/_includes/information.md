## General Information

-   The base endpoint URL is: https://v2.namsor.com/NamSorAPIv2
-   All endpoints return JSON containing either an object or a nested array of objects.
-   Batch processing returns the data sorted in the same order as it was sent.
-   **All endpoints require an API Key.**
-   Never share your API key to ANYONE.
-   Currently certain NamSor API endpoints use nested object structures in their query body and / or responses, please refer yourself to the corresponding code example.
-   Certain API response code examples have been truncated in order to improve readability. For example the countriesOriginTop, ethnicitiesTop and matchCandidates Array fields have been reduced to 2 elements in length.
