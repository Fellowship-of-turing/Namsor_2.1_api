## Credits

### What are Credits

We use a credit system to track usage. Each plan comes with a monthly quantity of credits and a price for request that exceed your monthly allowance. The free Basic subscription plan grants you 5000 credits but <a target="_blank" href="https://namsor.app/prices">other plans are available</a> in case you have higher requirements.

As an example, with 5000 credits you can either :

-   Process 5000 names to determine their gender
-   Process 500 names to determine their origin or ethnicity
-   Process 250 names to determine their diaspora

### Repeated Operations Tolerance

Our API features smart processing and it will not charge for analysing identical data for up to 20 times. For example if you submit the same full name 5 times in order to infer it's gender then you will only be charged 1 credit.

### Soft Limit vs Hard Limit

In your user account you may set two types of credit usage limits:

-   A soft limit that will trigger an email notification when reached.
-   A hard limit that will trigger an email notification and block the API key when reached.

### Track Usage

There are two ways to track your credit usage: check the provided graphics in your user account or query the appropriate Admin routes (API Usage, API Usage History and API Usage History Aggregate).
